  + Out of the box support for VS Code's vast array of basic code editing features like hot exit, find & replace, and code folding.
  + Editor extensions like VIM, bracket colorization, linters and many more are available while editing a cell.
  + Deep integration with general workbench and file-based features in VS Code.
  + Includes a notebook-friendly diff tool, making it much easier to compare and see differences between code cells, output and metadata.
  + Run several Magma environments in different Notebooks, each with corresponding variables and definitions.
+ Snippests
